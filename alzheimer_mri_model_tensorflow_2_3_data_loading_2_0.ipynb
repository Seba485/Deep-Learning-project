        "# LITERATURE REVIEW\n",
        "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and irreversible neurological disease caused by degeneration of some nerve cells. AD is the most common form of demen-tia (6th cause of death in the USA, from recent studies [12]), is prevalent in older age groups, with a higher percentage in those aged 85 or older [10]. The number of AD cases is expected to rise globally, making it a significant public health concern.\n",
        "Its main syntomps are loss of memory and other cognitive functions impairment that worsen patients life conditions and make them completely dependent for basic daily functions, eventually leading to death. Its early detection is crucial for slowing disease progression and a proper diagnosis of the patient requires classification of different dementia stages [5], as this parametre is informative about cells degeneration, disease seriousness and burden, and possi-bility of intervenctions.\n",
        "\n",
        "MRI is a non-invasive and not costly imaging technique widely used for AD diagnosis, also thanks to widespread avaliability of MRI images and scanners: it allows to assess integrity of brain regions and provides evidence of hippocampus and cortex shrink occurring in AD patients [9].\n",
        "In recent years, many Machine Learning algorithms were devolped for automatic AD detection. Among these, deep learning models seem preferable since they perform automatic feature extraction  from raw data and do not require handcrafted features of brain structures, labourious and time consuming. Among these, convolutional neural networks  are well-suited for analysing image data.  Moreover, according to some studies, transfer learning were most successfull due to the limited size of avaliable neuroimage datasets [9].\n",
        "Many works were presented in the last years that reached excellent performances in both simple detecting ([3] [4]) and classifying AD stage ([5],[2]) through deep-learning models. Major issues are limited amount of medical data that might  cause overfitting, the need for high computational resources for training these huge models and very unbalanced classes leading to misleading performances.\n",

        "# ABSTRACT\n",
        "\n",
        "*Description of the original project*:\n",
        "\n",
        "This project was about determining the dementia level of Alzheimers patients from their MRI images. The original code from kaggle provided a dataset organized in 4 classes corresponding to the dementia level: non demented, very mild demented, mild demented and moderate demented. First of all the dataset was split between test and training with a ratio of 20% and 80% (The used Deep Learning framework was Tensorflow). Then a CNN was trained exploiting the training set in order to classify the images belonging to the test set. After 100 epochs of training, both training and validation loss decreased over these; the model was tested with AUC metric on the test set and the results were optimal (AUC: 0.8360 - Loss: 1.5338)\n",
        "\n",
        "*Limitations of the original project*:\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if the values of the metrics suggested a good performance of the model, on the old dataset , these values looked too suspicious for us. We checked the model and everything seemed to be ok, so we took a close look at the dataset and we noticed that there was something strange. Additional information retrieved from past studies on the same dataset suggested the images in the train and in the test set belonged to the same patients, they were just different slices of the same MRI acquisition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another strong limitation of the original project is the limited evaluation of results: no confusion matrices were created, only loss and AUC on test set were computed as metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The given CNN applied to the original dataset, learns to detect patients but not to recognise the dementia level and classify correctly images (class-specific recall for three classes very low):  the model does not fulfill our expectations but just detects patients (all demented classes): we questionned whether this was an overfitting issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Objective*:\n",
        "\n",
        "Solve the problem of the dataset; Reduce the risk of overfitting over new dataset; Exploit additional metrics to evaluate the model; implement new methods to improve performances.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Methods*:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dataset:  it was quite impossible to tidy up the given dataset, so we choose to change the dataset using the one reported in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset/data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Hyperparametres tuning: in order to reduce the overfitting chances we tuned the model working on its hyperparameters such as the learning rate decay, L2- regularization weights and drop-out values. Furthermore, we performed data augmentation on the training set to balance the dataset.\n",
        "- Evaluation of the model: the trained model was evaluated on AUC,Loss and Accuracy, and a confusion matrix was built to better understand how the model performed. Also, recall, precision and balanced accuracy were considered.\n",
        "- Try to modify the model in order to fit better the new dataset.\n",
        "- Transfer learning: we used transfer learning methods to see if the usage of a more complex and pre-trained neural network could lead to better performances. We chose Denset121, Resnet50, Resnet101 and Vgg19. We froze the backbone, resized the input layer, and added in order a averagepooling layer, a dense layer activated by a Relu and the output layer in SoftMax activation.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Results*:\n",
        "\n",
        "Our model, with the original architecture proposed and without acquiring transfered knowledge, is not able to do classify the disease stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original model with the new dataset struggles to identify moderate demented and mild demented also using augmented data and after hyperarametres tuning. Moderate demented class is the most critical, while Mild Demented shows very little improvement in sensitivities with these precautions. We reach the conclusion that the main problem is the model architecture that is unsuitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer learning techniques on different models showed higher capabilities in fulfilling the purpose of the project.\n",

        "To deal with class imbalance issue, we have defined layers for data augmentation. For these, we referred to existing literature ([2], [3], [5], [8]), selecting transformation that do not modify the image size. For example in [5], width shift range, height shift range, and shear range were applied but our model didn't work as image size was altered. While we could have filled this with zero-padding or other filling techniques, we opted against it for the reasons of not having any experties and risking of making a dataset too \"artificial\". As a consequense, we decided to apply only the following transformations: random zoom in (height factor and width factot negative, see [Keras documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/) for more detail), random rotation, random flip, random  translation, and random brightness.\n",

        "Empty spaces are filled according to attribute fill_mode: we first put `fill_mode=\"reflect\"`, but looking carefully at augmented data we realised that augmented images were not suitable for \"representing\" original images (looked like aliasing artifact). So we changed `fill mode=\"constant\"` and it worked better, saving us from processing the image with operators and thresholds. Parameter interpolation is chosen to be \"bilinear\" which is good for general-purpose smoothing while it slightly blurs the image [11].\n",

One-hot encodings are a way for the model to understand that we're looking at categorial instead of continuous data.

        "NEW The function from the origina code changes data representation in an \"easier\" way: converts the label into a one-hot encoded tensor (one-hot representation with a depth of NUM_CLASSES) using TensorFlow's tf.one_hot function, and returns the original image along with its one-hot encoded label. Many deep learning models can operate only on numeric variables for the algorIthm efficiency [CITAZIONE 2]. For categorical variables for which no ordinal relationship exists, as these, the integer encoding is not enough. One hot encoding converts categorical data to numbers before fitting the model: a new binary variable (column) is added to the dataset for each unique categorical value in the variable (the presence or absence of a \"1\" in a column indicates the class of the input sample) and the original categorical variable is removed from the dataset ; STRENGTH OF ORIGINAL CODE: this avoids introducing ordinal relationships between labels because they are treated as distinct and unrelated; here this works well since target only has 4 possible values. One more reason to apply this function is that many loss functions, such as categorical cross-entropy [citation 3] expect the target labels to be in one-hot encoded format."

The initial idea was to perform a K-cross-validation but it is too time consuming, so once test and train set were fixed we tried different combinations of hyperparameters and based on the metrics plots  (AUC and loss valid / train) we chose the best one with manual visual evaluation. We decided not to tune optimization tecnique, which was set to be \"Adam\", since this already combines momentum damping  and gradient normalization, so we considered this the most efficient.
